Structure

Each model directory contains:

Training & Validation file → run training or hyperparameter tuning. (You might find the train main commented)

Inference file → run inference on new data.

Usage

To train or perform hyperparameter tuning, run the training cell(s).

To evaluate a pre-trained model, run only the cell bookmarked “evaluate” — no need to re-train.
